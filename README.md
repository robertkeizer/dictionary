# Random Wikipedia Scraping

This package does random wikipedia scraping.

It shoves the response into elasticsearch.

It gets a single page, then splits the page into words, and then queries wikipedia for that word.

I'm using it to eventually get data to shove into gephi or similar node-edge graph systems.
